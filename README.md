Project Analysis

Target user profile

The end user would be any company that I am interested in working with. I would like to provide all possible information related to my background in a simple and clear way. Anyone who sees my CV will be able to find my personal information, my academic background, and my work experience, as well as some projects I have undertaken at different times in my life.

Information architecture

This project, being a single-page design, will have all the information provided on it.

Visual design

My objective in this project is to convey a sense of security and professionalism in the design without it being overly boring. This way, the user is likely to take more time and perceive things differently when reading and analyzing my information.

The color palette will consist of various shades of blue with contrasts of black and white for the background and textual content. I have chosen these colors based on the emotions they convey: blue conveys security and tranquility, black adds elegance, and white is a pure and clean color.

Considering that Visual Studio Code doesn't offer a wide variety of fonts, for the regular text typography, I have opted for "System-ui." I find this font perfect for this project due to its simplicity and elegance, and it also has a modern feel reminiscent of the typography used in the iOS operating system. For the titles, on the other hand, I have chosen "Serif," a font with small serifs or embellishments that give it a more elaborate and classical appearance, creating a good contrast with the content.

My page design will be similar to a standard resume. Specifically, mine will have two distinct sections. On the left, there will be a blue rectangle containing my photo and the most personal information, such as contact details, a brief introduction about myself, and my projects. On the right, you'll find information more related to my academic and professional background.
